# Jokes Generator
This program was created in Czech Language. I want to create english version, too.

# How it generates jokes?
To make it simpler, I imported "random" to generate random integer (Line 10), and grab a joke from array called "jokes" (in Czech version, "vtipy").
Then, it will simply print out that joke.
